# CO₂ Emissions Forecasting using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict CO₂ emissions by country using machine learning models. The dataset includes historical data on emissions, GDP, and population, which are used to train and evaluate regression models.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the CORGIS Dataset Project and includes the following columns:
- `Year`: The year of the emission report.
- `Country.Name`: The name of the country.
- `Country.Code`: The abbreviation of the country.
- `Country.GDP`: The country's gross domestic product for a given year.
- `Country.Population`: The country's population for a given year.
- `Emissions.Production.CO2.Total`: The total amount of CO₂ produced (kilotons).

## Dataset Access

This project uses the [Global CO₂ Emissions dataset](https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/global_emissions)  
Due to file size constraints, please download the dataset manually and place it in this folder as:
